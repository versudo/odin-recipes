    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: Raw all-purpose flour can cause foodborne illness, so you’ll have
        to heat-treat it before adding it to the dough. Find heat-treating
        instructions in Step 1 of the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar lends a sweet, warm flavor.</li>
      <li>Butter: Beat the brown sugar with a stick of butter.</li>
      <li>
        Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the edible cookie dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but
        it won’t make the edible cookie dough taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and helps create the perfect texture.</li>
      <li>
        Chocolate chips: Use a blend of semisweet and mini chocolate chips for
        the perfect cookie dough experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
