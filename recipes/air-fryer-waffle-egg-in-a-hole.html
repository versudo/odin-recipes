    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Classic egg in a hole is made inside a waffle for a sweet, buttery
        flavor and added crunch.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
      <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or
        glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of
        parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the
        preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and
        pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has
        started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese
        onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is
        completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
